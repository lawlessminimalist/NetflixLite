# Netflix Lite‚Ñ¢
A not-quite-as-sophisticated attempt at how Netflix / Youtube stream their video content for wide-spread consumption.

## Overview

I'm going to break this down into multiple stages, each of increasing complexity in their methodology and implementation; with the aim being that at the end of this both you ‚òù and I üëá have a better understanding of how video streaming is done by these video wizards.


## Implementation's 

## Todo List

## Easy 
#### Client
- [ ] Write Front End for List of Videos
- [ ] Write Custom HTML5 Player to mimic Netflix UI
#### Server
- [x] Implement simple server endpoint in flask to send the entire video to the client
- [ ] Implement simple endpoint to list the manifest of files and metadata
- [ ] Research and document the process of adaptive streaming and how it's implmented at the server level
